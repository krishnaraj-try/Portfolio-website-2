        <h2>1.AN AI BASED REAL-TIME ROAD ANALYSIS SYSTEM USING MEMS DATA WITH IOT APPLICATION</h2>
        <h3>Project Description:-</h3>
        <ul>
         <li>Asphalt pavement distresses are the major concern of underdeveloped and developed nations for the smooth running of daily life commute. </li>
         <li> Among various pavement failures, numerous research can be found on pothole detection as they are injurious to automobiles and passengers that may turn into an accident. </li>
         <li>This work is intended to explore the potential of deep learning models and deploy three superlative deep learning models on edge devices for pothole detection.</li>
         <li>This work proposes a low-cost system for real-time detection of road pavement  surface conditions. </li>
         <li>The MEMS signals provided by on-car sensors are processed in the time–frequency domain in order to extract information about the condition of the road surface. </li>
         <li>The experimental results show that the proposed system is effective at detecting the presence and the type of distress with high classification rates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2.SIGN LANGUAGE HAND GLOVE USING ARDUINO</h2>
        <h3>Project Description:-</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, we made a sign language glove with Arduino.This project is made for the help of Dump people who can’t speak. so, with this awesome project, they can talk easily. why we are making these projects so that the reason is that the people who are impaired to talk and not capable to transfer their thought to the others. it will help to transfer the thought of that person to another person who is at the front of his/her. For example, if any person who can not speak and he want to drink the water he will not able to say this to another person but with this glove, he has to bend his finger only and the other person can easily read the sentence into the LCD attached in the project.<br />
            This glove is total works on the sensors. which are having the 5 sensors on 5 fingers. means one sensor on one finger respectively. and these sensors are the flex sensor. when we flex these sensors the value of the reading gets changes. so we will use this reading in our application. the flex sensor varies the values from 0 to 1023, so you have to modify your code according to the sensor value. we put all these sensors over the glove as we bent our finger the flex sensor also will be bent. so, when we bent our finger the reading got changed and the Arduino send the value on the LCD screen. for example, if we bent our first finger then the sentence on the LCD will be “I need food”. and if I bent my thumb then it will show “I need water”. same condition for the rest three fingers also.<br />
